### How can I get in contact with the Design System team?

You can reach out to us on one of our Slack channels (JET employees only):
- **#help-designsystem**
- **#guild-designsystem**
- **#guild-frontend**
- **#guild-accessibility**

We also run a [PIE engineering clinic](https://calendly.com/jetpie/engineering-clinics) every other Tuesday where you can book a slot to speak to one of our engineers.

type: "information",
message: "Note that the booking link only goes live the day before the clinic."

### How can I make a feature request?

Please use one of the workflows in the **#help-designsystem** channel to make a feature request, report a defect or request help for anything else.

### How can I find out which components have already been built?

You can take a look at our Storybook instances:
- [Vue](https://vue.pie.design/)
- [React for Takeaway.com](https://snacks.takeaway.com/)
- [React for SkipTheDishes](https://react.pie.design/)

### Can I build a new component?

Yes. If the component has been approved by designers then you are more than welcome to contribute.

Please speak to the Design System team about your requirements and we will help by guiding you.

### Can I make a custom implementation for a component that already exists?

No. We suggest that you raise a feature request describing your needs and we will discuss how they can be met by using (or extending) an existing component.
