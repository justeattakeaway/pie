## Introduction

One of the core aims of the **PIE Design System** is to provide engineers with a consistent set of components and best practices for creating and maintaining UIs across JET.

We develop and maintain several component libraries that implement the PIE design language. Please follow [this guide](/engineers/getting-started/structure/#which-library-should-i-use) to find out which library to use based on your tech stack.

For a more detailed look at the **component systems** the PIE team maintain, the PIE monorepo and how it’s structured, see the [structure section of our engineering docs](/engineers/getting-started/structure).

For a list of which components are supported in each of our libraries, please refer to the [Component Status page](/components/component-status/).

## Contributing & Guidelines

If you'd like to contribute to PIE, check out our [contributing guide](/engineers/contributing/).

We also maintain **guides** for global front-end best practices across JET. These can be found in the [engineering guidelines section of our docs](/engineers/guidelines/).

### Code and Project Structure

PIE Web Components, tools and documentation (including this site) are maintained on the open-source [PIE Monorepo on Github](https://github.com/justeattakeaway/pie).

We support and maintain a number of other projects that incorporate the PIE Design Language (such as [Fozzie](https://github.com/justeattakeaway/fozzie-components) for **VueJS components**, or [Snacks](https://snacks.takeaway.com/) and [Skip PIE](https://github.com/justeat/pie-project) for **React components**).

<!-- N.B. for the future – we should include a components summary section here like this when we want to start advertising our components:

## Components


- [Storybook](https://www.pie.design/storybook/)
- [Component Documentation](/components)
-->

### Need more help?

If you can't find the help that you need, or have any other questions about developing using PIE, please do get in touch with us either via the **#help-designsystem** channel (for JET engineers) or by raising a Github issue or discussion on the PIE mono-repo.
