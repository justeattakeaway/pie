One of the core aims of the PIE Design System is to provide engineers with a consistent set of components and best practices for creating and maintaining UI's across JET.

If you're just starting out with PIE, here's a list of recommended resources to get you started.

## Code and Project Structure

All of our PIE components, tools and documentation (including this site) are maintained on the open-source [PIE Monorepo on Github](https://github.com/justeattakeaway/pie).

For a more detailed look at our monorepo and how it's structured, see the [structure section of our engineering docs](/engineers/getting-started/structure).

We also help to maintain a number of other projects that incorporate the PIE Design Language (such as [Fozzie](https://github.com/justeattakeaway/fozzie-components) for VueJS components, or [Snacks](https://snacks.takeaway.com/) and [Skip PIE](https://github.com/justeat/pie-project) for React components).

If you're interested in knowing more about where we are in our engineering journey with PIE and how we got there, then check out the [vision and roadmap section]().

## Contributing & Guidelines

If you'd like to contribute to PIE, check out our [contributing guide](/engineers/contributing/).

We also maintain guides for global front-end best practices across JET. These can be found in the [engineering guidelines section of our docs](/engineers/guidelines).


<!-- N.B. for the future â€“ we should include a components summary section here like this when we want to start advertising our components:

## Components


- [Storybook](https://www.pie.design/storybook/)
- [Component Documentation](/components)
-->
