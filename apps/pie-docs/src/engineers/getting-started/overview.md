## Introduction

One of the core aims of the **PIE Design System** is to provide engineers with a consistent set of components and best practices for creating and maintaining UIs across JET.

If you're just starting out with PIE, here's a list of recommended resources to get you started.

---

## Code and Project Structure

All of our PIE components, tools and documentation (including this site) are maintained on the open-source [PIE Monorepo on Github](https://github.com/justeattakeaway/pie).

For a more detailed look at the **component systems** the PIE team maintain, the PIE monorepo and how it’s structured, see the [structure section of our engineering docs](/engineers/getting-started/structure).

We also help to maintain a number of other projects that incorporate the PIE Design Language (such as [Fozzie](https://github.com/justeattakeaway/fozzie-components) for **VueJS components**, or [Snacks](https://snacks.takeaway.com/) and [Skip PIE](https://github.com/justeat/pie-project) for **React components**).

## Contributing & Guidelines

If you'd like to contribute to PIE, check out our [contributing guide](/engineers/contributing/).

We also maintain **guides** for global front-end best practices across JET. These can be found in the [engineering guidelines section of our docs](/engineers/guidelines/overview).


<!-- N.B. for the future – we should include a components summary section here like this when we want to start advertising our components:

## Components


- [Storybook](https://www.pie.design/storybook/)
- [Component Documentation](/components)
-->

### Need more help?

If you can't find the help that you need, or have any other questions about developing using PIE, please do get in touch with us either via the **#help-designsystem** channel (for JET engineers) or by raising a Github issue or discussion on the PIE mono-repo.
