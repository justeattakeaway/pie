## Introduction

[Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) are a set of native browser technologies that allow us to build custom components. In other words, create custom HTML elements native to browsers.

Currently, this technology is supported by all browsers, making it possible to have one central library that will work with most frontend frameworks.

The long-term aim is to migrate JET teams over to this Web Component system, so we have one single source of truth for our global PIE components.
