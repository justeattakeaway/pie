## Introduction

[Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) are a set of native browser technologies that allow us to build custom components. In other words, create custom HTML elements native to browsers.

Currently, this technology is supported by all browsers, making it possible to have one central library that will work with most frontend frameworks.

The long-term aim will be to migrate JET teams over to this Web Component System, so we have one single source of truth for our global PIE components.

## Component status

You can find the documentation for all of our components on this site in the **Components** section.
