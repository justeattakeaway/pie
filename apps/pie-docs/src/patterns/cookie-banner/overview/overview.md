## Behaviours

### Background

#### Banner

The background page of the cookie banner isn’t disabled, and is only disabled once the modal is opened. The “Select your country” popover from the top navigation should sit on top of the banner so that the users can change the locale.

{% contentPageImage {
  src:"../../../assets/img/patterns/cookie-banner/behaviours-background-banner.svg",
  alt: "Banner positioned at the bottom with the “Select your country” popover on top of the banner.",
  width: 120
} %}

#### Modal

The background page is disabled when the modal is opened until the user has made a selection and is ready to continue with their flow, or returns to the banner. A scrim is applied and the banner disappears.

{% contentPageImage {
src:"../../../assets/img/patterns/cookie-banner/behaviours-background-modal.svg",
alt: "Cookie modal that positioned in the middle of the screen, on top of a dark overlay.",
width: 120
} %}

#### Turn all on / off

Once the overarching toggle is toggled on/off, the child toggles follow suit. The overarching toggle will not be toggled on unless all child toggles are selected.

{% contentPageImage {
src:"../../../assets/img/patterns/cookie-banner/behaviours-turn-all-on-off.svg",
alt: "Modal showing the toggles states when \"Toggle All\" is or is not selected.",
width: 120
} %}


---

## Positioning

### Banner

The cookie banner is always positioned at the bottom of the screen with default bottom, left and right padding of 16px from the container of the banner.

{% contentPageImage {
src:"../../../assets/img/patterns/cookie-banner/positioning-banner.svg",
alt: "Image of a frame with the banner positioned at the bottom.",
width: 120
} %}

### Modal

The modal is positioned in the centre of the screen with a scrim applied.

{% contentPageImage {
src:"../../../assets/img/patterns/cookie-banner/positioning-modal.svg",
alt: "Image of a frame with the modal positioned in the middle of the screen.",
width: 120
} %}

---

## Responsive design

### Narrow

At the narrow breakpoints, the banner has a maximum height of 432px, and the modal is set to full screen. If the content overflows due to a change in language, the available height, the call to action buttons and header become sticky and the body content scrolls.

#### Banner

{% contentPageImage {
src:"../../../assets/img/patterns/cookie-banner/responsive-banner.svg",
alt: "Responsive banner as it looks on mobile views showcasing a scroll bar for the content.",
width: 120
} %}

#### Modal

{% contentPageImage {
src:"../../../assets/img/patterns/cookie-banner/responsive-banner.svg",
alt: "Responsive modal as it looks on mobile views showcasing a scroll bar for the options and content.",
width: 120
} %}

## Motion

All motion details for the cookie banner can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/mJiLMfnMfnEYWJh2Njutdq/[Core]-Motion-[PIE-3]?type=design&node-id=804-3774&mode=design&t=6kQbKnf5Vr8ZyoIC-0), it also defines how the motion between the banner and modal overlap.

## Right-to-left languages

For languages that read right-to-left, the layout and alignment of the content is reorganised so the readability of the component makes logical sense.

### Wide

{% contentPageImage {

{% contentPageImage {

alt: "Modal displaying right-to-left content.",
width: 120
} %}

### Narrow

{% contentPageImage {
src:"../../../assets/img/patterns/cookie-banner/rtl-narrow-banner.svg",
