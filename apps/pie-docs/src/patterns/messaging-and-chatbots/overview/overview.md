## Overview

Messaging services facilitate the exchange of text, media, and information across platforms, allowing seamless interaction between users. These tools offer efficient, scalable, and personalised communication experiences.

Chatbots, powered by AI, simulate human conversations and allow users to request information on-demand using natural language. They should provide helpful and reliable responses that address the user's question or task.

## Working with third party platforms

### Customization 

Various platforms offer differing UI designs and levels of customisation. This means that your choice of platform will yield different end results, an important factor to consider when making your decision.

For most scenarios, the platform's out of the box UI kit will be used, providing essential functionality within the standard layout format. Basic customisation options will be available, allowing for content decisions and foundational updates.

If greater customisation is desired and justifiable within the means of the platform; more advanced levels of content control, layout adjustments, and additional functionalities will be available alongside foundational updates.

### UI kits

Depending on the platform you're using, there may be Figma UI kits available to assist in your design process. To check if a UI kit is readily accessible, please contact the PIE Design System team. If a kit isnâ€™t available, we can either help you source one or provide guidance on how to proceed without it.
