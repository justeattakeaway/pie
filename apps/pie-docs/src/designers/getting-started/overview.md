## Introduction

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/ui-design-tool) is PIE’s **design tool** of choice for building our design system. All design-related foundations, components and assets are stored in Figma libraries and files. This is to ensure the whole digital ecosystem can be accessed by any team.

We recommend you use Figma through the **desktop app**. If Figma’s desktop app is not installed on your computer, get in touch with your manager to request this.

As a designer within the Just Eat Takeaway organisation, you’ll automatically have access to all of PIE’s libraries and files. If you don't have access, please [get in touch with the PIE team](/support/contact-us) to request it.

## How is PIE structured?

PIE is split into three parts: **foundations**, **components** and **assets**. Each of these are arranged into libraries, so they can be easily found and referenced.

You’ll need to enable these libraries if you want to use the PIE design system for your products.

### Foundations libraries

Foundations are the **building blocks** of our design system. They are owned by PIE designers and are consistent across components, products and pillars.

They include: colour, typography, elevation, radius, spacing and others.

Foundations are split into two themes: **PIE 2.0 Light** and **PIE 2.0 Dark**. Each theme has its own library, so please check with the PIE team if you're unsure which one to use.

### Core Components libraries

Core components are the pieces we use to create JET products. They are owned by PIE designers and are consistent across components, products and pillars.

They include: buttons, labels, chips, input fields, and more.

Our core components are also split into two themes: **PIE 2.0 Light** and **PIE 2.0 Dark**. Each theme has its own library, so please check with the PIE team if you're unsure which one to use.

### Asset libraries

Assets are the images we use across JET products, such as icons and illustrations. They are owned by PIE designers, in collaboration with the JET Creative Studio (Brand team).

### Business Area libraries

Business area libraries contain components which are unique to a specific business area, such as Customer, Partner or Operations.

These libraries are owned by designers in the relevant business area. PIE designers will occasionally review these libraries to ensure the components are consistent with the main component libraries.
