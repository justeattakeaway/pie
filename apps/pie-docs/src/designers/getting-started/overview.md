## Introduction

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/ui-design-tool) is PIE’s design tool of choice for building our design system. All design-related foundations, components and assets are stored within Figma libraries and files to ensure the whole digital ecosystem can be accessed by any team.

You can access Figma through the browser, but it is recommended that you use the desktop app. If Figma’s desktop app is not installed on your computer, get in touch with your manager to request this.

As a designer within the Just Eat Takeaway organisation, you’ll automatically have access to all of PIE’s libraries and files. However, if that’s not the case, please [get in touch with the PIE team](/support/contact-us) to request access.

## How is PIE structured?

We have divided our foundations, components and assets into multiple libraries, so they can be easily found and referenced. All of them can be found on the [Getting started with Figma files](/designers/getting-started/figma-files) section.

You’ll need to enable these libraries if you want to use the PIE design system for your products.

### Foundations libraries

These libraries contain the building blocks for our design system. In these libraries you’ll find the styles created using colour, typography, elevation, radius and spacing (among others). These foundations should remain consistent across components, products and pillars.

PIE designers own and maintain our foundation libraries, which are split into two different themes (PIE 2.0 Light and PIE 2.0 Dark). Make sure you’re working from the right library, and check with the PIE team if you’re unsure about which one you should use.

### Core Components libraries

Our core component libraries are made up of all the components that are used by multiple business areas and teams. These include components like buttons, labels, chips, input fields (among others). These components should remain consistent across products and pillars.

Similarly to foundation libraries, these components are maintained and owned by PIE designers, and they are split into two different themes (PIE 2.0 Core Components – Light and PIE 2.0 Core Components – Dark). Make sure you’re working from the right library, and check with the PIE team if you’re unsure about which one you should use.

### Asset libraries

These libraries contain assets which can be used in our products, such as icons and illustrations. They are owned and maintained by PIE designers in collaboration with the JET Creative Studio (Brand).

### Business Area libraries

Business Area libraries were created to provide more flexibility to our teams. Components which are unique to a specific Business Area (such as Customer, Restaurant…) and would not be relevant in other ones live within these libraries.

Business Area designers own these libraries, and PIE designers only help with maintaining them and making sure they are consistent with our Core Components libraries. You can learn more about how we support these libraries in our [Getting Support](/designers/how-we-support-you) section.

## Additional guidelines

We’ve compiled some additional guidelines to help you get a better understanding of JET’s visual and verbal standards.
