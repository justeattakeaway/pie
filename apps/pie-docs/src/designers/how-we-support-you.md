## Introduction with changes for test

PIE is both a service and a product to the organisation. As a team, we not only create and maintain all aspects of the design system, but also provide support to our pillars and business areas.

Our goal is never to take ownership from designers in pillars, so we try to provide you with as much flexibility as possible. We're always here to support you and help your products align to the system.

---

## Our support models

There are three different ways we can help you implement PIE within your products.

If you're unsure about which way might be best for you or your team, or would like to know more about how we can support you, please [get in touch with us](/support/contact-us).

### Mentoring

With Mentoring, the business area designer is in charge of creating the component, following the contribution process outlined in our [Contribution](/designers/contributing) section.

During this process, a PIE designer will support the business area designer by reviewing the work, offering help and providing feedback at any stage.

You can take a closer look at this in our [mentoring process](https://www.figma.com/file/BRwqw7B4dm4mVPdvfVLSNY/Process?node-id=440%3A1574&t=3PXkTh6rokGiG3sG-4) file.

} %}

### Cleanup

With Cleanup, the business area designer creates the component only **requesting support if/when needed**. Designers must ensure they create the new component following the contribution process outlined in our [Contribution](/designers/contributing) section.

Once the component is finished, a PIE designer will help the business area designer finalise and finesse the component, making sure it aligns with our design system.

You can take a closer look at this in our [cleanup process](https://www.figma.com/file/BRwqw7B4dm4mVPdvfVLSNY/Process?node-id=440%3A1723&t=3PXkTh6rokGiG3sG-4) file.

} %}

### Partnership

With Partnership, the business area designer **will work closely with a PIE designer** throughout the component creation process, from research and testing, right through component building and finalisation.

You can take a closer look at this in our [partnership process](https://www.figma.com/file/BRwqw7B4dm4mVPdvfVLSNY/Process?node-id=440%3A3052&t=aVebo2jjEWjKMFwI-0) file.

## The role of the PIE designer

PIE designers are specialists in systems thinking and design systems maintenance. Our role is not just to define foundations, components, patterns and documentation, but also to provide you with guidance on how to use PIE and implement it consistently throughout your products.

As a result, we're often asked how PIE designers work together with business area designers. To help describe it, we've put together a list of the things we do and don't do as part of our role:

### What we do:

{% list {
    type: listTypes.icon,
    iconName: "check-circle",
    iconFill: "support-positive",
    items: [
        "Provide guidance and support with foundations, components and patterns",
        "Create, update and maintain our foundations, components and patterns",
        "Write documentation about the system’s elements’ behaviours and interactions",
        "Assist business area designers when they create their own components"
    ]
} %}

### What we don’t do:

{% list {
    type: listTypes.icon,
    iconName: "close-circle",
    iconFill: "support-error",
    items: [
        "Screen designs",
        "Prototype flows",
        "Specify **your** product's rules",
        "Maintain business area libraries"
    ]
} %}
