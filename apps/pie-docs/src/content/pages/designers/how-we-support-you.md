title: How we support you
description: In this section you’ll find everything you need to know about the ways in which we support different teams across the organisation.

## Introduction

PIE is both a service and a product to the organisation. As a team, we not only create and maintain all aspects of the design system, but also provide support to our pillars and business areas.

Our goal is never to take ownership from designers in pillars, so we try to provide as much flexibility for you as possible. However,  we are always here to support and help your products align to the system, helping you improve the digital expression of our brand and keep consistency with the rest of our digital ecosystem.

## Our support models

We have come up with three different support models which can help you improve the way you implement PIE within your products.

If you’re unsure about which model might be best for you or your team, or would like to know more about how we can support you, please [get in touch with us]().

### Mentoring

With the mentoring model, the business area designer is in charge of creating the component following the [contribution process]() outlined in our [Contribution]() section.

During this process, a PIE designer will support the business area designer by reviewing the work, offering help and providing feedback at any stage.

You can check the process closely in our [Process]() file.

} %}

### Cleanup

With the cleanup model, the business area designer creates the component only **requesting support if/when needed**. Designers must ensure they create the new component following the [contribution process]() outlined in our [Contribution]() section.

Once the component is finished, a PIE designer will help the business area designer finalise and finesse the component, making sure it aligns with our design system.

You can check the process closely in our [Process]() file.

} %}

### Partnership

With the partnership model, the business area designer **will work closely with a PIE designer** throughout the component creation process, from research and testing, right through component building and finalisation.

You can check the process closely in our [Process]() file.

## The role of the PIE designer

PIE designers are specialists in systems thinking and design systems maintenance. Our role is not just to define foundations, components, patterns and documentation, but also provide you with guidance on how to use PIE and how to implement it consistently throughout your products.

As a result of that, we’re often asked how PIE designers are usually involved when working together with business area designers. To help describe it, we’ve put together a list of the things we do and don’t as part of our role:

### What we do:

{% list {
    type: listTypes.icon,
    iconName: "check-circle-filled",
    iconFill: "support-positive",
    items: [
        "Provide guidance and support with foundations, components and patterns.",
        "Create, update and maintain our foundations, components and patterns.",
        "Write documentation about the system’s elements behaviour and interactions.",
        "Assist business area designers when they create their own components."
    ]
} %}

### What we don’t do:

{% list {
    type: listTypes.icon,
    iconName: "close-circle-filled",
    iconFill: "support-error",
    items: [
        "Screen designs.",
        "Prototype flows.",
        "Specify **your** products rules.",
        "Maintain business area libraries."
    ]
} %}
