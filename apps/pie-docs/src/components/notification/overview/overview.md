## Overview

The purpose of notifications is to promptly inform users about relevant information or changes that require their attention. Notifications can be used to communicate messages like new messages, system updates, completed actions, errors or reminders.

Notifications often include options for users to interact with the displayed information, such as dismissing the notification, taking action or accessing related content. They play a crucial role in keeping users informed and engaged with the application or system.

## Variations

### Neutral

Neutral notification provides generic messages to users that may not be related to the current action or task they’re performing. Does not require immediate action and can be dismissed on a timer or persist, depending on the content.

{% contentPageImage {
    src:"../../../assets/img/components/notification/variation-neutral.svg",
    alt: "The neutral variant of the notification component.",
    width: 1024,
    variant: "secondary"
} %}

### Neutral alternative

Exists as an alternative option to Neutral that can be visible over grey backgrounds, with the same usage as the neutral variation.

{% contentPageImage {
    src:"../../../assets/img/components/notification/variation-neutral-alternative.svg",
    alt: "The neutral alternative variant of the notification component.",
    width: 1024
} %}

### Info

Provide additional information to users that may not be related to the current action or task they’re performing. Do not require immediate action and can be dismissed on a timer or persist, depending on the content.

{% contentPageImage {
    src:"../../../assets/img/components/notification/variation-info.svg",
    alt: "The info variant of the notification component.",
    width: 1024
} %}

## Modifiers

### Compact

The action(s) relocate to be in line with the supporting text, which helps to reduce the vertical space. The close prop is not available due to the repositioning of the actions.

{% notification {
  type: "information",
  message: "If the close icon is required, don’t use the compact prop."
} %}

{% contentPageImage {
    src:"../../../assets/img/components/notification/modifier-compact-with-title.svg",
    alt: "The compact variant of the notification where the trailing icon, title, supporting text and actions are on the same line.",
    width: 1024
} %}

{% contentPageImage {
    src:"../../../assets/img/components/notification/modifier-compact-without-title.svg",
    alt: "The compact variant of the notification where the trailing icon, supporting text and actions are on the same line.",
    width: 1024
} %}

### Icons

    alt: "A notification component with a title, supporting text and dismiss button only",  
    width: 1024
} %}

{% usage {
    do: {
        type: usageTypes.image,
        hasPadding: false,
        items: [{
            src: "../../../assets/img/components/notification/modifier-icons-replacing-icons-do.svg",
            alt: "An error notification that uses a cross icon as a trailing icon to indicate the order is canceled",
            width: 524
        }]
    },
    dont: {
        type: usageTypes.image,
        hasPadding: false,
        items: [{
            src: "../../../assets/img/components/notification/modifier-icons-replacing-icons-dont.svg",
            alt: "An error notification that uses a microphone icon as a trailing icon to indicate the order is canceled",
            width: 524
        }]
    }
} %}

### Title

The title can be removed where it is not necessary.

{% contentPageImage {
    src:"../../../assets/img/components/notification/modifier-title.svg",
    alt: "A notification with only a trailing icon, supporting text and dismiss button",
    width: 1024
} %}

### Actions

#### Dual actions

{% contentPageImage {
    src:"../../../assets/img/components/notification/modifier-actions-dual-actions.svg",
    alt: "A notification with a title, a trailing icon, supporting text, dismiss button and two action buttons",
    width: 1024
} %}

    src:"../../../assets/img/components/notification/modifier-actions-single-action.svg",
    alt: "A notification with a title, a trailing icon, supporting text, dismiss button and one action button",
    width: 1024
} %}

#### No actions

{% contentPageImage {
    src:"../../../assets/img/components/notification/modifier-actions-no-actions.svg",

    width: 1024
} %}

## Usage


{% componentDetailsTable {
  tableData: usage
} %}

---

## Content

Notifications provide limited space for content, and therefore the content must be short and concise. A user should be able to quickly scan the notification, be apprised of the situation, and know what to do next.

### Title

- The title should be short and descriptive, explaining the most important piece of information.
- When possible, communicate the main message using just the title.

### Supporting text

- Be concise and avoid repeating or paraphrasing the title.
- Limit content to one or two short sentences.

---

## Interactions

### Close icon

When the user clicks the icon button, the notification is dismissed.

{% contentPageImage {
    src:"../../../assets/img/components/notification/interaction-close-icon.svg",
    alt: "A notification component with a dismiss button",
    width: 1024
} %}

### Actions

The actions in the notification can do things like redirecting the user. This might result in the notification closing once a task is done, or it could directly close the notification.

{% contentPageImage {
    src:"../../../assets/img/components/notification/interaction-actions.svg",
    alt: "A notification component with a user action buttons",
    width: 1024
} %}

---

## Narrow

All props are available in narrow screen sizes.

{% contentPageImage {
    src:"../../../assets/img/components/notification/narrow.svg",
    alt: "The notification component on narrow screens",
    width: 360
} %}

### Compact

{% notification {
  type: "information",
  message: "It’s recommended that the compact prop isn’t used below 600px, due to available horizontal space."
} %}

{% contentPageImage {
    src:"../../../assets/img/components/notification/narrow-compact.svg",
    alt: "The notification component on narrow screens and compact mode where all content  is in one line to accommodate for space",
    width: 600
} %}

### Actions

Actions have the option to wrap on narrow screens due to the available horizontal space.

{% notification {
  type: "information",
  message: "Not available in conjunction with the compact prop."
} %}

{% contentLayout %}
  {% contentItem %}
    {% contentPageImage {
      src: "../../../assets/img/components/notification/narrow-dual-actions.svg",
      width: "360px",
      alt: "A notification component for narrow screens that includes a leading icon, title, supporting text, a dismiss button, and action buttons. The action buttons are stacked and span the entire available space."
    } %}
  {% endcontentItem %}
  {% contentItem %}
    {% contentPageImage {
      src: "../../../assets/img/components/notification/narrow-single-action.svg",
      width: "360px",
      alt: "A notification component for narrow screens that includes a leading icon, title, supporting text, a dismiss button, and one action button that spans the entire available space."
    } %}
  {% endcontentItem %}
{% endcontentLayout %}
