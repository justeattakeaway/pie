## Overview
The purpose of spinners is to communicate activity and progress to users, assuring them that the system is actively working and that their requested action is being processed. They enhance the user experience by reducing uncertainty and providing feedback during waiting periods.

Spinners are commonly used to indicate tasks such as content loading, data retrieval or processing that may require some time.

## Size

Outlines the spinner sizes that are available, and where they should be used across our products.

{% componentDetailsTable {
tableData: sizes

## Placement

Spinners should always be centred horizontally and vertically within the viewport, container, or component they indicate is loading.

### Page

The spinner should be centred in the viewport to indicate a full-page loading state.

{% contentPageImage {
    src:"../../../assets/img/components/spinner/spinner-placement-page.svg",
    width: 580,
    alt: "Three grey rectange sections with orange spinner placed top right"
} %}

### Section

The spinner should be centred in the loading section to indicate which section is loading.

{% contentPageImage {
    src:"../../../assets/img/components/spinner/spinner-placement-section.svg",
    width: 580,
    alt: "Inverse light variation of the spinner component"
} %}

### Components

The spinner should be centred within the component to indicate that an action is being processed.

{% contentLayout %}
  {% contentItem %}
    {% contentPageImage {
      src: "../../../assets/img/components/spinner/spinner-placement-component-1.svg",
      width: 70,
      alt: ""
    } %}
  {% endcontentItem %}
  {% contentItem %}
    {% contentPageImage {
      src: "../../../assets/img/components/spinner/spinner-placement-component-2.svg",
      width: 48,
      alt: ""
    } %}
  {% endcontentItem %}
{% endcontentLayout %}

## Interactions

### Drag on mobile

Mobile devices don't have a hover cursor, so dragging actions might not be the most intuitive choice on mobile screens. If youâ€™re using a draggable card container in your mobile designs, make sure to provide clear context and guidance to the user.
