## Overview
Data tables are commonly used to display tabular data, such as lists of records, datasets, or information with multiple attributes, in a way that is easy to comprehend and interact with. This improves data readability and facilitates efficient data exploration and analysis.

They also provide a comprehensive view of data, allowing users to search, sort, filter and perform various actions to make informed decisions and extract meaningful insights from the presented information.
