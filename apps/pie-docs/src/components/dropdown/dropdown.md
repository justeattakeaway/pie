## Overview
The purpose of dropdowns is to provide a compact and organised way to display a set of selectable items, such as categories, filters, or actions, within a user interface.

Dropdowns enhance user experience by conserving screen space and organising choices in a structured manner, making it convenient for users to access and select from a range of options.
