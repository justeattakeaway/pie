## Overview
The purpose of thumbnails is to improve the user experience by offering a visual preview of content without the need to load or display the full-sized version immediately. Thumbnails help users quickly identify items of interest, making it easier for them to choose which items they want to view in more detail.

Thumbnails are commonly used in cards, image grids, file managers and various other scenarios to provide users with a quick overview of multiple items.
