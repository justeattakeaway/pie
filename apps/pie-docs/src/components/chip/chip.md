## Overview

The purpose of chips is to provide a visual representation of a specific entity or attribute, such as a selected option or a labelled category. Chips can also be interactive, allowing users to remove or modify the selected choices.

Chips are commonly used in various contexts, including filtering options, search results or any situation where concise and visually distinct information needs to be displayed.
