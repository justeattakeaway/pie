## Overview
The purpose of select inputs is to allow users to easily and accurately choose a single option from a predefined list. Typically used in forms, they provide a compact and efficient way to present a list of options and enable user selection.

Select inputs consist of a clickable area that, when activated, displays the available options in a native dropdown menu. Users can then choose one option by clicking or tapping on it, and the selected option replaces the initially displayed selection.
