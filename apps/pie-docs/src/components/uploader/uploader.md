## Overview
The purpose of uploaders is to enable users to transfer files from their local devices to the platform. They are commonly used in various scenarios, such as file sharing, document submissions, media uploads, and content management systems.

Uploaders can appear as a button or a designated drop zone where users can click or drag-and-drop files for uploading. After selecting the files, the uploader initiates the upload process, and users can monitor the progress of their uploads.
