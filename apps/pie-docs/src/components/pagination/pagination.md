## Overview
The purpose of a pagination component is to provide users with a systematic way to navigate through multiple pages of content. By dividing content into smaller sections, users can easily browse through the information, access specific pages and navigate back and forth between pages.

Pagination is commonly used in websites, applications, or documents that present a significant amount of data or content that cannot be displayed on a single page. It helps organise and present the content in a more manageable and accessible manner.
