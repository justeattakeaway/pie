## Overview
The purpose of segmented controls is to provide users with a clear and visually appealing way to choose from a set of mutually exclusive options. They simplify navigation and input by presenting options in a compact and easily scannable format.

Segmented controls are often used to allow users to switch between different views, filter content, or make a selection from a set of options. Each segment functions as a separate button or tab, and when one segment is selected, the others are automatically deselected.
