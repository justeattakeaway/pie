## Overview

The purpose of carousel indicators is to provide users with a visual cue about their current position and the total number of slides available in the carousel. As the user navigates through the slides, the corresponding indicator is highlighted to reflect the active slide.

Carousel indicators can be clicked or tapped to directly navigate to a specific slide, providing additional control and flexibility to the user.
