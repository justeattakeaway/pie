## Overview
The purpose of interactive list items is to provide users with the ability to perform actions or make selections directly within the list. This enhances the usability and functionality of the list, allowing users to engage with the content or perform tasks.

Interactive list items can contain additional elements like checkboxes, radio buttons or icons that trigger specific actions or enable selection.
