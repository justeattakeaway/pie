## Overview
The purpose of the rating component is to gather user feedback and/or provide a visual representation of the collective ratings. It helps users make informed decisions, provides social proof and assists in evaluating the quality or popularity of a product or service.

Ratings are commonly used in review systems, product ratings or feedback forms where users are asked to provide their subjective assessment.
