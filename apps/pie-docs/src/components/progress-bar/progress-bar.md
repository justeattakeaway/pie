## Overview
The purpose of progress bars is to inform users about the progress of a task, reducing uncertainty, and providing a visual sense of completion. It helps manage expectations, improves user experience, and gives users a sense of control and understanding.

You can use progress bars in your products to show the progress of uploads and downloads, software installations, form submissions, loading processes, or any task that involves sequential progress.
