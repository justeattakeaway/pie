## Overview
The purpose of icon buttons is to offer a visually engaging and efficient way for users to interact with various functions or actions within an interface. They allow for clear and concise communication of functionality, particularly in situations where text may be less practical or necessary.

Icon buttons feature simple and recognizable icons that represent a specific action or functionality. They are often used in toolbars, navigation menus, or interactive elements where space is limited or a visual representation is more intuitive than text.
