## Overview

The purpose of cards is to provide a cohesive and structured way of displaying content. Cards are interactive, allowing users to click or tap for more details or to perform specific actions related to the displayed item.

Cards are designed to present concise and focused information organised in a visually appealing manner. They are commonly used to showcase individual items, such as products or articles, and are usually arranged in a grid or stacked layout.
