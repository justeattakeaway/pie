## Overview
The purpose of progress steppers is to guide users through a series of steps, visually indicating their progress and completion status. It helps users navigate complex processes, maintain a sense of orientation, and ensures a smoother user journey.

Progress steppers are commonly used in multi-step forms, onboarding processes, checkout flows or any situation where a complex task is divided into manageable steps. They enhance the user experience by providing a visual roadmap and aiding in task completion.
