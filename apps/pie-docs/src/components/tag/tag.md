## Overview
The purpose of tags is to provide a quick and visually appealing way to highlight or identify specific items, topics or attributes. Tags enhance the user experience by simplifying content organisation and facilitating content discovery and filtering.

Tags can be embedded in other components such as cards, data tables (among others) to help users understand and filter information more effectively.
