## Overview
The purpose of sliders is to provide users with a flexible and intuitive way to adjust and select values within a continuous range. They are commonly used for inputting numeric values, controlling settings, filtering data or performing other interactive actions that require selecting a value within a specified range.

Sliders consist of a draggable handle that users can slide horizontally along a track. The track represents the range of values, and its length or position corresponds to the value or range being selected.
