## Overview
The purpose of numeric steppers is to facilitate accurate and efficient input of numeric values, especially within predefined limits or step sizes. They help prevent input errors and offer a more convenient user experience by providing a visual and interactive way to adjust numerical data.

Numeric steppers are commonly used in forms, data entry fields, or settings panels where precise numeric input is required. They provide an intuitive and accessible means for users to input or adjust values without the need for manual typing.
