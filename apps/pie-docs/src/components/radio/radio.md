## Overview
The purpose of radio buttons is to provide users with a clear and intuitive way to make a single selection from a set of options. They are commonly used in forms, surveys, preference settings or any scenario where users need to make a mutually exclusive choice.

Radio buttons consist of small circular elements often accompanied by descriptive text. When a user selects one radio button, it automatically deselects any previously selected radio buttons within the same group.
