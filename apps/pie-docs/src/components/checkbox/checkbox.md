## Overview

Checkboxes provide a binary selection mechanism where users can either check the box to indicate they want a particular option or leave it unchecked to indicate they do not want that option.

They are commonly used in forms, settings panels, and various other interfaces where users need to make multiple selections or provide input from a predefined set of options.
