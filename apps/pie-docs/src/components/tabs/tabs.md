## Overview
The purpose of tabs is to simplify navigation and provide a clear organisation of content. They offer an intuitive way for users to switch between different sections or views within the same interface, reducing clutter and improving the user experience.

When a user clicks or taps on a tab, the corresponding content is displayed while hiding the content of other tabs. This allows users to switch between different sections of the interface without navigating to separate pages or screens.
