## Overview
The purpose of date pickers is to simplify the selection and input of dates, reducing errors and enhancing the user experience when working with date-related data or functionalities.

Date pickers display a calendar grid, allowing users to navigate through months and years to find the desired date. By clicking or tapping on a specific date, users can select it, triggering actions like populating a field or modifying items in the interface.
