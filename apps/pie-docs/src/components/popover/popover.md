## Overview
The purpose of popovers is to provide supplementary information or functionality without disrupting the main content or requiring users to navigate to a different page or screen. 

Popovers are displayed as a small box that contains text or interactive elements, and they help improve the user experience by offering relevant context and options precisely where they are needed.
