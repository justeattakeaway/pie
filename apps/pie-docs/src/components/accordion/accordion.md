## Overview

Accordions are vertical stacks of headers that categorise content. Clicking or interacting with a header expands or collapses its associated content, enabling users to selectively view information while keeping the interface clean.

Accordions are useful for presenting categorised information like FAQs, product features, or menus, and managing large content volumes while ensuring a streamlined user experience.
