## Overview
Bar charts are commonly used to compare and visualise data sets, showing the relative sizes or magnitudes of the data points. They are particularly effective for displaying discrete data, such as categorical or numerical information

In a bar chart, each category or variable is represented by a bar, where the length or height of the bar corresponds to the value it represents. The bars are arranged along the horizontal (x) axis or vertical (y) axis, with equal spacing between them.
