## Overview
Line charts are commonly used to visualise and analyse data that changes over time, such as prices or rates of growth. They help identify patterns, trends, and fluctuations in the data, making it easier to understand and interpret the information.

In a line chart, the horizontal (x) axis represents the time or independent variable, while the vertical (y) axis represents the dependent variable. Each data point is plotted on the chart, and the lines connecting them show the overall pattern, direction, and magnitude of the data.
