## Overview
The purpose of links is to provide a visual and interactive way for users to explore and navigate through an interface. By clicking or tapping on a link, users can quickly access additional information or move to a different location, enhancing their browsing experience and enabling efficient interaction.

Links are often used to connect various pages, sections, or external resources, creating navigation menus and directing users to related content. They also enable interactions like opening new tabs or windows.
