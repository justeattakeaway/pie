## Our global spacing scale

We have defined a series of global tokens to define our various spacing measures. The global spacing scale works in increments of 8px and 4px.

{% tokensTable {
    path: 'spacing.global',
    tokenType: tokenTypes.SPACING
} %}

## Why do we use 8px and 4px increments?

We use an 8px and 4px grid because theyâ€™re easily divisible by 4 and 2. This makes it easy to resize any element or component without the need to use half-pixels.

## The importance of sticking to the space scale

Sticking to the space scale is key to every great design. Spatial systems, grids and layouts help us keep a consistent rhythm in our designs, promotes easier decision making and helps our products look visually aligned.
