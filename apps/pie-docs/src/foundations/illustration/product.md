 ## Product Illustration sets

We have two illustration sets that can be used in our products. Some illustrations have both Small and Large variations, they look similar but not identical.

### Small scale illustration

Our small illustrations are designed to be simpler with fewer details, making them suitable to used at smaller sizes and for use in containers, modals, or compact designs.

{% contentPageImage {
    src: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/product/stampcards-small.png",
    width: "107px",
    mobileWidth: "95px",
    caption: "The example above shows what our ‘Stampcards’ illustration looks like on the Small scale."
} %}

### Large scale illustration

Our large illustrations are more elaborate, with added complexity and floating background. They’re typically used directly on the page background or in more spacious design areas.

{% contentPageImage {
    src: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/product/light-stampcards-large.png",
    width: "173px",
    mobileWidth: "152px",
    caption: "The example above shows what our ‘Kebab bowl’ icon looks like on the Large set."
} %}

---

## Sizing

To maintain detail and clarity, we have suggested a range of sizes for each illustration scale.

{% notification {
    type: "warning",
    message: "Illustrations minimum size is 64px."
} %}

{% notification {
    type: "information",
    message: "You can always use [a large icon](/foundations/iconography/overview/#large-icon-set) if you need a visual smaller than 64px."
} %}

### Size for the Small scale illustration

The recommended size for our small scale illustrations are between 64px - 120px. We will also allow up to 140px if necessary.

{% contentPageImage {
    src: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/product/small-set-size-range.png",
    mobileSrc: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/product/mobile/small-set-size-range--mob.png",
    width: "296px",
    mobileWidth: "93px",
    caption: "The example above shows the range of sizes that can be used for the Small scale illustration."
} %}

### Size for the Large scale illustration

For large illustration scale, the recommended size is 140px - 500px.

{% contentPageImage {
    src: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/product/large-set-size-range.png",
    mobileSrc: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/product/mobile/large-set-size-range--mob.png",
    width: "539px",
    mobileWidth: "140px",
    caption: "The example above shows the range of sizes that can be used for the Large scale illustration."
} %}

## Background

Some illustrations contain a floating background, which is an abstract shape that sits behind our illustrations to give them depth.

### Small scale illustration

#### No background

To keep the our small scale illustration simple and clean, they have no background elements.

{% contentPageImage {
    src: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/product/order-on-its-way-1b-small.png",
    width: "90px",
    mobileWidth: "80px",
    caption: "The example above shows the Small scale illustration has no background element."
} %}

### Large scale illustration

#### Light background

Light background variant is used on light theme.

{% contentPageImage {
    src: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/product/light-out-for-delivery-1-large.png",
    width: "160px",
    mobileWidth: "140px",
    caption: "The example above shows the light background variant in the Large scale illustration."
} %}

#### Dark background

Dark background variant is used on dark theme.

{% contentPageImage {
    src: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/product/dark-out-for-delivery-1-large.png",
    width: "160px",
    mobileWidth: "140px",
    variant: "inverse",
    caption: "The example above shows the dark background variant in the Large scale illustration."
} %}

## Using Product illustrations in your products

Illustration has the potential to bring playfulness and delight to our products, making the user interface more engaging and enriching the user experience.

In this section we'll look at some of the factors you need to consider when using Product illustrations in your design.

### Hierarchy

There is a hierarchy we follow when using visual assets in our products.

We always seek to use photography first and most prominently as part of our visual identity, so we can showcase delicious menu items or delightful moments.

Iconography is used to guide users through our products both functionally and visually.

Illustrations should be used minimally, to add elements of personality and delight where appropriate.

{% contentPageImage {
    src: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/product/hierarchy.png",
    width: "358px",
    width: "206px",
    caption: "The example above shows the hierarchy when using visual assets in our product."
} %}

### Responsive design

It is recommended using the same illustration scale on all devices for the same design.

When adjusting the size of the illustration to suit the devices, be aware of the minimum and maximum sizes of the illustration's scale. For example, if using large scale illustrations on web, please ensure that the size does not fall below 140px on mobile/tablet, nor exceed the maximum sizes.

{% contentPageImage {
    src: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/product/responsive-design.png",
    mobileSrc: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/product/mobile/responsive-design--mob.png",
    width: "757px",
    mobileWidth: "303px",
    caption: "The example above shows both desktop and mobile designs are using Large scale illustrations within the appropriate sizes."
} %}

### Consistency

If several illustrations are used as a group, stick to either small or large illustrations. Do not combine the use of both illustration scales in the same use case.

To ensure our illustrations stay consistent, they should never be recreated, recoloured, or altered in any way.

{% usage {
    do: {
        type: usageTypes.image,
        items: [{
            src: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/product/consistency-do.png",
            width: "600px",
            mobileWidth: "245px",
            alt: "Using the same (small) illustration scale in the same use case."
        }]
    },
    dont: {
        type: usageTypes.image,
        items: [{
            src: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/product/consistency-dont.png",
            width: "600px",
            mobileWidth: "245px",
            alt: "Using a mix of large and small illustration scales together in the same use case."
        }]
    }
} %}

### Pairing with Product illustrations

#### Text

Illustration should pair with explanation text for clarity. As a general guideline, aim to incorporate illustrations to relevant text labels or titles. However, do not put text over the illustrations.

#### Pattern illustration

When combining the use of Product and Pattern illustrations, make sure the elements that sit on top of the Pattern illustration is accessible.<br />
For more guidance, please see [Pattern / Fallback illustration](/foundations/illustration/pattern/) page.

{% usage {
    do: {
        type: usageTypes.image,
        items: [{
            src: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/product/pattern-illustration-do.png",
            width: "370px",
            mobileWidth: "296px",
            alt: "Pairing illustration with text and greyscale background."
        }]
    },
    dont: {
        type: usageTypes.image,
        items: [{
            src: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/product/pattern-illustration-dont.png",
            width: "370px",
            mobileWidth: "296px",
            alt: "Pairing illustration with text and colourful background."
        }]
    }
} %}

### Use illustrations sparingly and thoughtfully

Use illustrations meaningfully in our products - whether it's softening an error message, explaining a complicated process, or celebrating that a customer's order is on the way.

We recommend to only use illustrations once per communication - this might be a single illustration, or a sequence of illustrations explaining a customer journey.
