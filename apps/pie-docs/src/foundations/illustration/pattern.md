## Pattern / Fallback illustration set

We have two sets of illustrations that serve as decorative purposes or as an alternative when a primary photo or design cannot be used or is not displayed correctly.

### Pattern illustration

Our Pattern illustrations include food ingredients, shapes, colours and other visual elements. They could be used as fallback images, headers and backgrounds.

{% contentPageImage {
    src: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/pattern/pattern-illustration.png",
    width: "500px",
    mobileWidth: "253px",
    caption: "The example above shows what our Pattern illustration looks like."
} %}

### Food-specific fallback illustration

The food-specific fallback illustrations have 20 variations with different types of food. They are used as fallback illustrations for restaurant-related photos and specific cuisines.

{% contentPageImage {
    src: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/pattern/food-specific-fallback-illustration.png",
    width: "500px",
    mobileWidth: "253px",
    caption: "The example above shows what our Food-specific Fallback illustration looks like."
} %}

### Colours

Depending on the level of visual prominence you want the illustrations to have, you can choose the Pattern illustration between these colour styles:

{% notification {
    type: "information",
    message: "Food-specific fallback illustrations are only available in Bitone Orange colour."
} %}

{% contentPageImage {
    src: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/pattern/colours.png",
    mobileSrc: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/pattern/mobile/colours--mob.png",
    width: "646px",
    mobileWidth: "204px",
    caption: "The example above shows the colour options for the Pattern illustration."
} %}

### Using Pattern / Fallback illustrations in your products

Since our Pattern and Fallback illustrations are designed for specific use cases, in this section we'll look at some of the factors you need to consider when using Pattern and Fallback illustrations in your design.

#### As fallback images

Food-specific fallback illustrations are used when restaurant photos are not available, they can be used as restaurant images or headers. Please use the appropriate food variant to represent the restaurantâ€™s cuisine.

For all other purposes, please use pattern illustrations instead.

{% contentPageImage {
    src: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/pattern/fallback-images-1.png",
    width: "300px",
    mobileWidth: "240px",
    caption: "The example above shows the Food-specific fallback illustration is used for restaurant photo."
} %}

{% contentPageImage {
    src: "../../../assets/img/foundations/illustration/pattern/fallback-images-2.png",
    width: "390px",
    mobileWidth: "273px",
    caption: "The example above shows the Pattern illustration is in the cuisine carousel - a non-restaurant purpose."
} %}

#### Pattern as background

Only Pattern illustrations can be used as backgrounds.

When using Pattern as a background, we recommend choosing the appropriate colour style with opacity:
- 30% - 50% for greyscale
- 20% - 40% for other colour variations
- Avoid using colourful Pattern as background.

When combined with text, ensure that the text is accessible with the darkest colour in the background (with opacity).

When combined with product illustrations, it is recommended to use a greyscale Pattern.
