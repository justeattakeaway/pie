## Overview

A **design system** is like a recipe for creating visually appealing and user-friendly products. Just as a recipe has different ingredients and instructions for cooking a delicious meal, a design system has different components, patterns and documentation which help us when designing digital products such as websites or apps.

For example, just as a recipe might call for specific amounts of ingredients and cooking times to ensure a perfect dish, a design system might dictate certain font sizes, colour palettes, and layout rules to ensure consistency and usability across all JET products.

In both cases, following the recipe or design system instructions helps to ensure a consistent and high-quality end result.

## How we support teams

PIE is both a service and a product to the organisation. We create and maintain its contents and guidelines, but we also support other teams through [business area libraries](https://www.figma.com/file/KND7Higqcvksz7WkXRKLHm/PIE-Microsite?node-id=3204%3A188255&t=CBkGw0yndbtBW9TK-0){target="_blank"}.

Our goal with these isn’t to take ownership from designers. Instead, we are here to support these teams and ensure their products align to the system, preserving scalability, consistency and craft.

You can learn more about our **support models** in our [How we support you](/designers/how-we-support-you) page.
