### Default

This should be used as the default colour for all of our links.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.Default} />


### High Visibility

Uses a blue colour to increase the visibility of the link.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.HighVisibility} />


### Inverse

It should be used in areas where an inversed background is used, or when contrast between the default or high visibility links isnâ€™t sufficient to pass accessibility rules.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.Inverse} />
