# CSS setup
[Source code](https://github.com/justeattakeaway/pie/tree/main/packages/tools/pie-css) | [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@justeattakeaway/pie-css)

In order for our components to render correctly, you will need to install our base CSS package, `@justeattakeaway/pie-css`. This package contains all the CSS variables and base styles required for our components to work correctly.
Most of these CSS variables are what are known as [Design Tokens](https://pie.design/foundations/design-tokens/). They are a vital part of our design system, and are used to ensure consistency across all of our components.

## Installation

Simply install the package using your preferred package manager:

**Using Yarn:**

```bash
yarn add @justeattakeaway/pie-css
```

**Using NPM:**

```bash
npm install @justeattakeaway/pie-css
```

## Usage

How you include these styles will largely depend on the type of application you are building (and your own preference), but here are a few examples:

### JS or Framework import (via bundler)
```javascript
// This is ensure the index.css file is included in your bundle
import '@justeattakeaway/pie-css';
```

#### React
In React (or NextJS), you could add the import to your `App.js` file:

```javascript
import '@justeattakeaway/pie-css';

function App () {
    return (
        …
    );
}

export default App;
```

#### Vue

Similarly, in Vue 3, you will likely include it as part of your `/src/main.ts` file:

```javascript
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import '@justeattakeaway/pie-css';
import App from './App.vue';

createApp(App).mount('#app');
```

#### Nuxt

If you are using Nuxt, you can import the CSS into your `nuxt.config.js` file.

```javascript
// Nuxt v3
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    css: ['@justeattakeaway/pie-css'],
    …
});
```

```javascript
export default {
    css: [
        '@justeattakeaway/pie-css',
    ],
    …
}
```

### SCSS
If you are using Sass, you could import the CSS file as part of your styles directly.

```SCSS
@use 'node_modules/@justeattakeaway/pie-css/dist/index.css';
```

### Native HTML
Of course, you could include the styles straight inside your HTML document – most likely you'd want to link to the `/@justeattakeaway/pie-css/dist/index.css` CSS file in the head of your HTML from your `node_modules` folder.
