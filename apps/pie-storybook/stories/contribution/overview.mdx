## 1. Get involved

Before starting a new component, please contact the Design System team. They will help define requirements and ensure the component is suitable for the shared library.

## 2. Machine setup

Set up your development environment for the PIE monorepo.

### Required tools

- Install a code editor ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) recommended)
- (Optional) Install the [PIE VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JamieMaguire.pie-design-system-vscode-prototype)
- (Optional) Go to `Extensions` in VSCode and install all recommended extensions found in `.vscode/extensions.json`
- Install [Git secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets)
- Install [Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started) (manages Node/Yarn versions):

### Environment Variables

Request these from the Design System team:

- `TURBO_TOKEN` - used to gain access to Turborepo remote caching
- `PERCY_TOKEN_{COMPONENT}` (e.g. `PERCY_TOKEN_PIE_BUTTON`) - allows you to run Percy visual regression tests for a component locally

Add them to your environment:

> How to best add these to your environment will depend on your operating system. If in doubt, feel free to reach out to the Design System team for help!

```bash
# ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
export TURBO_TOKEN=your_token
export PERCY_TOKEN_PIE_BUTTON=your_token
```

## 3. Clone the repository

Start by cloning the [PIE monorepo](https://github.com/justeattakeaway/pie) and installing dependencies via `yarn install`.

> Make sure you're on the `main` branch and have synced the latest changes before starting new work.

## 4. Scaffold a new component

Use our [Yeoman generator](https://github.com/justeattakeaway/pie/tree/main/packages/tools/generator-pie-component) to create a new component.

Follow the README for usage.


### Percy setup
Once you have created the new component, you will need to also create a new project in Percy:

1. You may need to ask for admin rights to Percy and the Pie repository on Github. Ask an admin if needed.

2. Go to percy: https://percy.io/4bc223d1

3. Create new project

4. Name the project after the component (e.g. pie-avatar)

5. Point the repository at Pie

6. Set the *Default base branch* and *Auto-approve branches* to `main`

7. Go into the Pie repository settings in Github and go to *Secrets and Variables*

8. Create a new secret with the name of the percy project in the format of `PERCY_TOKEN_PIE_<COMPONENT>`
for example `PERCY_TOKEN_PIE_LINK`

9. Add this token locally using the same naming format. Where you add your environment variables will differ depending on your machine. On Mac, it could be in `~/.zshrc`, for example.

## 5. Develop the component

### Start storybook

```bash
yarn dev --filter=@justeattakeaway/pie-storybook
```

### Watch the component for changes

In another window whilst Storybook is being served:

```bash
yarn watch --filter=@justeattakeaway/pie-{component-name}
```

### Build the component

This is not usually needed during development as running watch will also build the component

```bash
yarn build --filter=@justeattakeaway/pie-{component-name}
```

### Set the component status

In `package.json`:

```json
"pieMetadata": {
    "componentStatus": "alpha"
}
```

Please do not change the status without agreement from the Design System team. All new components start in `alpha`. See [here](https://pie.design/components/component-status/#status-descriptions) for more information.

## 6. Component package anatomy

This is the typical structure for a PIE component:

```
component-name/
├── dist/
├── src/
│   ├── component-name.scss
│   ├── defs.ts
│   ├── defs-react.ts
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── react.ts
│
├── test/
│   ├── accessibility/
│   │   └── component-name.spec.ts
│   ├── component/
│   │   └── component-name.spec.ts
│   ├── helpers/
│   │   └── page-object/
│   │       └── selectors.ts
│   └── visual/
│       └── component-name.spec.ts
│
├── custom-elements-manifest.config.mjs
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── tsconfig.json
├── turbo.json
├── vite.config.js
├── playwright-lit-visual.config.ts
└── playwright-lit.config.ts
```

### File breakdown

- **package.json** - Metadata, dependencies, `pieMetadata`
- **README.md** - Usage and development notes. This is imported into Storybook as the `Overview` page for a component.
- **tsconfig.json** - TypeScript configuration
- **vite.config.js** - Vite dev/build config
- **turbo.json** - Turborepo monorepo config
- **custom-elements-manifest.config.mjs** - Custom Elements manifest setup. [More information](https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest).
- **playwright-lit-visual.config.ts** - Visual testing Playwright config
- **playwright-lit.config.ts** - General Playwright test config

### Source directory (`src/`)

- `component-name.scss` - Component styles
- `defs.ts` - Type definitions
- `defs-react.ts` - React types used by the React wrapper
- `index.ts` - Component entry and exports
- `react.ts` - Component entry and exports for React (this is an untracked file created during build)

### Test directory (`test/`)

- `accessibility/component-name.spec.ts` - Accessibility checks
- `component/component-name.spec.ts` - Component browser tests
- `helpers/page-object/selectors.ts` - Page object helpers for tests
- `visual/component-name.spec.ts` - Visual regression tests

## 7. Testing standards

Please read our [testing guide](?path=/docs/contribution-testing-overview--docs).

## 8. Add a changeset (if needed)

For consumer-facing changes, run:

```bash
yarn changeset
```

Select the packages affected by your code changes and change type. Make sure to prefix your message with one of the following:

- `[Added]`, `[Changed]`, `[Fixed]`, `[Removed]`

Keep the description simple and easy to understand.

## 9. Create a pull request

Please ask for pull request reviews in the **#help-designsystem** channel.

### Branch naming

Use format: `dsw-123-my-feature` where `dsw-123` is the ticket ID.

### Commit messages

Use `yarn cz` to generate commits.

Format:

```
type(scope): DSW-123 your message
```

### Pull request title

Format:

```
type(scope): DSW-123 your PR title
```

Complete the [pull request template](https://github.com/justeattakeaway/pie/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md). Otherwise DangerJS checks will fail.


## 10. Trigger a snapshot release

For pull requests with a new changeset, comment `/snapit` to trigger a snapshot release of affected packages once the CI checks have completed. You will now have a published version of the component to test in either [PIE Aperture](?path=/docs/contribution-testing-aperture-integration-tests--docs) or another application.

Alternatively, you can comment `/test-aperture` to trigger a snapshot release and open a pull request installing it directly into PIE Aperture.
