# Testing

Building a component library using web components presents a number of interesting challenges;
unlike building a component for Vue or React, we have to ensure our components
are compatible with multiple frameworks and server-side rendering processes. This means when
building our components, we must be be writing tests that ensure our components:

1. **Behave** as expected in the browser
2. Follow the **design** specifications
3. Render correctly during **SSR** (server-side rendering)
4. Meet **accessibility guidelines**
5. Integrate correctly into the **web application frameworks** we support (Vue, React and the meta-frameworks Nuxt and Next.js)

In addition to testing our components, we have other libraries that contain core functionalities that make building our components easier.
These libraries can contain things like custom Typescript decorators, base classes, mixins and functions. These things must also be tested in isolation
to ensure they work as expected.

## Kinds of tests

We group our tests into the following categories. Please visit the individual guides linked below for more information.

- [Unit tests](?path=/docs/contribution-testing-unit-tests--docs)
- Component browser tests
- Visual tests
- Accessibility tests
- Aperture integration tests
