# Component browser tests

When testing web components, we aim to verify real behavior in real browsers. We use **Storybook** and **Playwright** to run our tests directly in the browser, rather than relying on simulated environments or mocked DOM APIs. This ensures our components work as users actually experience them.

## Dos and Don’ts

| ✅ Do                                                                 | ❌ Don’t                                                             |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Test in a real browser using Playwright and Storybook                | Rely on jsdom or shallow rendering for core behavior tests           |
| Use realistic interactions (clicks, keypresses, form submissions)    | Simulate state changes without reflecting how users trigger them     |
| Validate behavior that affects users or integration                  | Test trivial props that don’t affect output or UX                    |
| Check accessibility roles                   | Assume correctness based on code without verification                |
| Use Playwright’s async actions to wait for real changes              | Use hardcoded timeouts if they can be avoided        |
| Test integration points (e.g. forms, events, attributes)             | Break test naming conventions         |
| Think about edge cases and failures                                  | Over-test happy paths or every prop permutation                     |
| Keep tests clear, focused, and valuable                              | Write tests for the sake of coverage or completeness                 |

## Why test in the browser?

Browser tests are our primary form of component testing because:

- **They reflect real-world usage.** We interact with components as users do: clicking buttons, submitting forms, focusing fields, etc.
- **They run in an actual browser.** This gives us confidence that things like events, focus behavior, and HTML semantics work as expected.
- **They help catch integration issues.** For example, we can test how components interact with forms, accessibility features, and the surrounding page.

## What do we test?

We focus on behavior that **matters to users**. We write tests to:

- Verify the component renders the correct HTML (button vs anchor, input types, etc.)
- Confirm accessibility and form behavior (submission, validation, reset, etc.)
- Ensure props like `disabled`, `isLoading`, or `type` affect behavior correctly
- Validate keyboard interactions (e.g. pressing Enter)
- Confirm correct DOM output or network behavior when necessary (e.g. `postData` in submissions)

We avoid writing exhaustive tests for every prop or permutation unless there's a **clear risk or value**.

## Testing philosophy

- **Be practical.** Test what users will do, not every possible prop.
- **Use real scenarios.** Set up components in Storybook with realistic data.
- **Catch edge cases.** Think about unusual but possible usage, like pressing Enter without a visible submit button.
- **Avoid noise.** Don't write tests that assert obvious defaults or duplicated logic unless those are critical.

## Test naming conventions and structure

To keep our browser tests clear and consistent, we follow a structured approach for naming and organising them.

### Structure

> All component test files use a naming convention of: `/test/component/{component-name}.spec.ts`. When creating a new component, the [component generator](https://github.com/justeattakeaway/pie/tree/main/packages/tools/generator-pie-component) will create this for you.

We use `test.describe` blocks to group related tests logically:

- **Top-level describe:** The name of the component (e.g., `PieTextInput - Component tests`)
- **Nested describe:** A specific feature or prop being tested (e.g., `Props`, `Events`, `Slots`)
- **Test cases:** Individual behaviors or conditions

**Example*:*

```js
test.describe('PieTextInput - Component tests', () => {
    test.describe('Props', () => {
        test.describe('type', () => {
            test('should apply the type prop to the HTML input rendered', async ({ page }) => {
                // ...
            });
        });
    });
});
```

### Naming guidelines

Use the following patterns when naming test cases:

| Pattern                                   | Example                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `should [do something]`                   | `should render successfully`                                  |
| `should [do something] when [condition]`  | `should apply the type prop when provided`                    |
| `should not [do something]`               | `should not submit the form when disabled`                    |
| `should [do something] with [input]`      | `should submit form with correct data`                        |
| `should [do something] on [event]`        | `should emit change event on blur`                            |
| `should [do something] if [prop/flag]`    | `should focus input if autoFocus is true`                     |

### Best practices

- Keep test cases small and focused on a single behavior.
- Use the **Arrange–Act–Assert** structure for clarity.
- Avoid vague names like `works correctly` or `renders properly`.
- Prefer clarity and readability over brevity in test names.
