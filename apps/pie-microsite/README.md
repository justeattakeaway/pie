## Known gotchas and quirks
- A quirk not exclusive to 11ty, but common to anything rendering markdown into HTML, is that sometimes the first line of text will not be correctly parsed. This can lead to the markdown being rendered as is rather than turning into HTML. For example, use of a `### Heading level 3` may render exactly as you see it there. This can be solved by (annoyingly) creating an empty new line at the top of the markdown file.
