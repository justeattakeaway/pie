## What is PIE?

**PIE** (Principles for Interfaces and Experiences) is a design system made up of components, patterns, documentation and code. It allows us to build consistent products and high quality design solutions across the organisation.

Using these pre-built, reusable assets we can enhance the speed at which our teams work while maintaining the alignment between their products.

---

## What is the goal of PIE?

We want to make our products awesome by making modern, accessible, flexible and reusable components. And help our teams work faster and more efficiently, to let them focus on solving new problems instead of rebuilding the same assets; for more information please visit [What is PIE]().

---

## What if PIE doesn’t fulfill our team’s requirements?

PIE should always be there for you. To achieve this, we want to make sure we understand what you’re trying to achieve and how we can help you achieve it.

We’re always committed to review our Core Components if there are changes and suggestions that might benefit your team (as well as others).

Keep in mind that you can always contribute directly to PIE Business Area libraries. With our support, you’ll be able to add or amend components, while we keep an eye on the quality and consistency of the user experience.

Please check our contributing guidelines for [Designers]() and [Engineers]() for more information on how you can collaborate with us.
