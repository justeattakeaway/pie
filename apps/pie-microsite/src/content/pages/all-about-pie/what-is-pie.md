description: Principles for Interfaces and Experiences (PIE) is Just Eat Takeaway’s global design system.

## Overview

PIE is a **design system** made up of components, patterns, documentation and code. It allows us to build consistent products and high quality design solutions across the organisation.

Using these pre-built, reusable assets we can enhance the speed at which our teams work while maintaining the alignment between their products.

---

## Why should you use PIE?

Here are six reasons why you should use PIE for your products:

### Consistency

PIE provides a single source of truth for designers and developers, which keeps your products consistent and minimises the chance of human errors.

### Reusability

We design and build reusable and scalable components that can be used throughout our products by designers, developers and other teams.

### Craft & Quality

We have specialist developers and designers focusing their energy on crafting and maintaining our design system, and who are here to support you at any time.

### Accessibility

We make sure that we design and build with all users in mind. We have accesssibility built in from the start and test accessibility every step of the way.

### Efficiency

By using our library of pre-designed and built components, you can work faster and focus your energy on solving new problems instead of re-building the same assets.

### Alignment

No matter if you are a designer, iOS, Web or Android developer, PIE provides you with a common language and goal.

## How we support teams

PIE is both a service and a product to the organisation. We create and maintain its contents and guidelines, but we also support other teams through [business area libraries](https://www.figma.com/file/KND7Higqcvksz7WkXRKLHm/PIE-Microsite?node-id=3204%3A188255&t=CBkGw0yndbtBW9TK-0){target="_blank"}.

Our goal with these isn’t to take ownership from designers. Instead, we are here to support these teams and ensure their products align to the system, preserving scalability, consistency and craft.

You can learn more about our **support models** in our [How we support you](/content/pages/designers/how-we-support-you) page.
