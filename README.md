## Introduction

PIE (Principles for Interfaces and Experiences) is Just Eat Takeaway's global design system.

The PIE monorepo has several distinct sections, including:
  - pie-docs: This holds the content for our documentation site [pie.design](https://pie.design/).
  - pie-storybook: A playground for testing Web Component changes. See [webc.pie.design](https://webc.pie.design).
  - components: This contains all the Web Components in the design system.

## Contributing

This guide contains all the information required for you to set up the repository and run everything locally, from the documentation site to Web Components. It also provides information on how to commit code, as well as versioning and publishing.
