# generator-pie-component

`generator-pie-component` is a generator for Pie Web Components.

---

## Usage

### Installation

Install `yeoman` globally:

```sh
$ npm install --global yo
```

Build the generator package locally

```sh
$ yarn build --filter=generator-pie-component
```

### Running the generator

To run the generator, use this command from the root directory within the monorepo:

```sh
$ yo @justeattakeaway/pie-component
```

An interactive prompt should now be displayed asking for a component name.

Once you have completed all the prompts, your scaffolded component will be generated ðŸŽ‰

_Note: If this step fails, ensure you have installed the repository dependencies with `yarn`. Otherwise this (and any other commands) will fail. You will also need to list the component as a dependency in the storybook package.json._

#### Setting up Visual Regression Testing:

- Create a Percy project for the component on the Percy website.
- Update the test:visual command in package.json to the following:

```sh
"test:visual": "run -T cross-env-shell PERCY_TOKEN=${PERCY_TOKEN_COMPONENT_NAME} percy exec --allowed-hostname cloudfront.net -- npx playwright test -c ./playwright-lit-visual.config.ts",
```
- Add the token environment variable to `github/workflows/ci.yml` as follows:

```sh
  PERCY_TOKEN_COMPONENT_NAME: ${{ secrets.PERCY_TOKEN_COMPONENT_NAME }}
```

## Local development

Install the dependencies. Note that this, and the following commands below, should be run from the **root of the monorepo**:

```bash
yarn
```

To build the `generator-pie-component` package, run the following command:

```bash
yarn build --filter=generator-pie-component
```

You can also build the component in `watch` mode if desired with the following command:

```bash
yarn watch --filter=generator-pie-component
```

## Contributing

In order to contribute to the `generator-pie-component`, it's advised to link your local build of the generator to Yeoman.

To do this, run `yarn link` from the root of the `generator-pie-component` folder in the mono-repo.

Once you have done this, running `yo @justeattakeaway/generator-pie-component` will run your local copy of the generator (rather than the version installed globally via NPM/Yarn).
