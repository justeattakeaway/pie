## pie-lottie-player

`pie-lottie-player` is a Web Component built using the Lit library.

This component can be easily integrated into various frontend frameworks and customized through a set of properties.

## Installation

To install `pie-lottie-player` in your application, run the following on your command line:

```bash
# npm
$ npm i @justeattakeaway/pie-lottie-player

# yarn
$ yarn add @justeattakeaway/pie-lottie-player
```

For full information on using PIE components as part of an application, check out the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/justeattakeaway/pie/wiki/Getting-started-with-PIE-Web-Components).

### Importing the component

#### JavaScript

```js
// Default – for Native JS Applications, Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc.
import { PieLottiePlayer } from '@justeattakeaway/pie-lottie-player';

// If you don't need to reference the imported object, you can simply
// import the module which registers the component as a custom element.
import '@justeattakeaway/pie-lottie-player';
```

#### React

```js
// React
// For React, you will need to import our React-specific component build
// which wraps the web component using ​@lit/react
import { PieLottiePlayer } from '@justeattakeaway/pie-lottie-player/dist/react';
```

> [!NOTE]
> When using the React version of the component, please make sure to also
> include React as a [peer dependency](#peer-dependencies) in your project.

#### Nuxt and SSR

When adding this component to a Nuxt application in combination with SSR settings, it might happen to receive the error "500 customElements.get(...) is not a constructor" during the preview of the built application.

That is likely due [a known issue](https://github.com/prashantpalikhe/nuxt-ssr-lit/issues/137) with the module that enables using Lit components in Nuxt with SSR, `nuxt-ssr-lit`.

To solve the issue, update or add the `nitro.moduleSideEffects` array in `nuxt.config.ts`:

```
  nitro: {
      moduleSideEffects: [
          '@justeattakeaway/pie-lottie-player',
      ],
  },
```

## Peer Dependencies

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using `pie-lottie-player`, you will also need to include a couple of dependencies to ensure the component renders as expected. See [the PIE Wiki](https://github.com/justeattakeaway/pie/wiki/Getting-started-with-PIE-Web-Components#expected-dependencies) for more information and how to include these in your application.

## Props

| Property         | Type      | Default | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| animationSrc | `String` | - | Lottie animation JSON file URL or relative path. animationSrc and animationData are mutually exclusive. |
| animationData | `Object` | - | Object with Lottie animation data. animationSrc and animationData are mutually exclusive. |
| loopDisabled | `Boolean` | false | By the default animations loop, setting this prop as true will prevent such behaviour. |
| autoPlayDisabled | `Boolean` | false | By default animations start playing as soon as its data is available, setting this prop as true will prevent such behaviour. |
| speed | `Number` | 1 | Determines the animation reproduction speed. 1 is the regular speed, 2 is twice as fast. |
| direction | `String` | forward | Sets the animation reproduction direction. |

In your markup or JSX, you can then use these to set the properties for the `pie-lottie-player` component:

```html
<!-- Native HTML -->
<pie-lottie-player animationSrc="./animation-file.json"></pie-lottie-player>

<!-- JSX -->
<PieLottiePlayer animationSrc="./animation-file.json"></PieLottiePlayer>
```

## Acessibility

Currently the component is always hidden from screen readers because animations should only be decorative and supplementary. Any important meaning and context should be presented alongside the animation as text.

For the users with the "Reduce motion" setting enabled, the animation will be paused on the first frame.
